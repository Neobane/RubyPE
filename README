RubyPE Project
Developed by Neobane
Project Description:  In an effort to learn more about the Ruby programming language, I am using Ruby to solve the problems on the Project Euler website.  This code is my efforts to solve these problem.

WARNING:  I am an amateur Ruby programmer.  I make no guarantees to the effectiveness or accuracy of my programs.
As I am learning both Ruby and advanced mathematics at the same time, the odds are that these programs are going to be extremely inefficient if they work at all.
This repository is simply a container to hold my code so that I may work on them from multiple locations.  It is not intended to be used to solve the project problems by people other than me.
